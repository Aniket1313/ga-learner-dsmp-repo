### Project Overview

 This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Here, aim is to build a **linear regression** model to predict the **price** of a set.


### Learnings from the project

 	•	Train-test split
	•	Correlation between the features
	•	Linear Regression
	•	MSE andR^2Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First, we separated the features and target variables into X and y. After dropping the unwanted features, we split the data into test train split making 60:40 . Finally, after fit the Linear Regressor we get an R2 score of about  77.47
